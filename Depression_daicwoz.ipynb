lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film that's great  <laughter>  when was the last time that happened  last time i made a film just this last october made a short film  what was it about <laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally mhm that sounds interesting  thanks <laughter>  what are some things that make you really mad  really mad uh  <laughter> really mad i you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad  uh oh  yeah  that sucks  <laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school  do you find it easy to be a parent  no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy   yeah  what's the hardest thing about being a parent  <sigh>  the hardest thing about being a parent  i would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very uh  um annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so    uh huh that sounds really hard  mm yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it you as a parent you're happy they got it  that's good what's the best thing about being a parent  <sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they  aw yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but <laughter>  you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you're a good person so i like that  yeah that's so good to hear  hmm what do you think of today's kids  oh <laughter> my god they're ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed uh huh  and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong yeah i see what you mean  hmm what do you do when you're annoyed  me <laughter> just <sharp inhale> breathe in <sharp exhale> and breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation  okay  when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about argued  i argued with my fiancee uh a couple months ago about gosh i forgot i i forgot i don't remember  it was petty yeah but it didn't last long 'cause she's like me she doesn't like to argue about stuff we like to take care of stuff as it happens and that's it hmm how do you know them  my fiancee yes <laughter> well um well i mean we met um when i was working at at a charter <ch> not a charter school but at a recreational center we met there and uh we talked we hit it off uh we didn't see each other for an entire year and then uh we reconnected and we went on a date and it was great ever since wow that's great how close are you to your family  my family we're pretty close my brother lives in colorado my sister lives in oklahoma i have a dad that lives in a neighboring city where i am um as close as we can be with the distance and certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away and um but my immediate family like you know my fiancee and my daughter like we're close and it's great okay  do you travel a lot <laughter> i don't travel enough but i have traveled a couple of times uh within the last five years i just came back from new zealand so that was a great experience  nice yeah  what do you enjoy about traveling  i enjoy meeting new people that's the biggest thing about traveling i like seeing new things i like just immersing myself in different cultures and situations and i like just being away from it all that's that's good too mhm i'd love to hear about one of your trips  well i went to new zealand uh not too long ago and i had <ha> stayed there for a week um i learned about celsius 'cause you know here we have fahrenheit and that was fun uh i learned how to play cricket   uh i learned how to get myself out of a capsized kayak and um i learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good i like lamb but they had a lot of lamb oh and their seafood <seaf> seafood i can't eat but they do have really great chocolate chocolate is <sigh> it was so good and ice cream was good too and uh the people were really really nice they it was a very special time for me to go there it was great and they accepted me i love that and yeah can't wait to go back  that sounds like a great situation  <laughter> yes it was what would you say are some of your best qualities  some of my best qualities um energetic uh very personable uh intelligent i am easy to get along with i work pretty hard and i'm very slow to getting upset about things  that's good  have you ever served in the military  no  have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d no have you been diagnosed with depression  no how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep  mm it's fairly easy  what are you like when you don't sleep well <laughter> uh i guess i get pretty moody you know i could be a little little snappy at people when i don't sleep well when i have lack of sleep but once i get some sleep in me i'm okay okay  how have you been feeling lately  mm fine  that's good  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  no no no changes no okay  how would your best friend describe you  scrubbed_entry um you know he would say that i'm pretty funny um lax about a lot of things uh i enjoy life as much as i possibly can um good friend to have around and always ready and eager to help okay  what are some things that usually put you in a good mood  <laughter> just waking up in the morning <laughter> it's always a great thing uh i love ice cream that's always good i love laughing ugh if somebody's laughing especially my fiancee 'cause she has a great laugh then aw that puts me in a good mood that's so good to hear  hmm thank you  who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life  scrubbed_entry and that's what i wanna do i definitely wanna get into acting and really work it and get some really good roles so he's been a positive influence he stayed out of trouble um he's maintained a good working relationship with people and he's always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging      how do you know them  oh we went to junior high school and high school together so he's my best friend  wow yeah  that's a long time <laughter> yes it is  what's one of your most memorable experiences  wow there's so many uh  scrubbed_entry had uh these bag of m and m's and we had went to a play and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didn't particularly care for but you know that's how kids are you just they don't know how to you know they say they don't like somebody but you know <laughter>  anyway but we got these m and m's and while the it was dark we start throwing m and m's and hitting 'em in the head with the m and m's and then we came to school like three days later uh we were summoned and there was a mock trial to get <laughter>  scrubbed_entry so we were able to get ourselves off on like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime uh oh  and but then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldn't allow us to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like two days  aw what are some things you like to do for fun  oh man you name it uh i love scuba diving i've only done it twice but i love it wanna get back into it like traveling uh i love exercising i actually like working out now uh i used to think it was a chore but now i'm really really getting into it that i love watching movies you put me in front of a good movie and i'm a happy camper so that's about it hanging out with family  okay  is there anything you regret  anything i regret hmm <deep breath> you know what i think i <laughter> i probably regret not going up to will smith when i had the chance  can you tell me about that  yeah uh will smith was coming up the street and i saw him and i got so nervous i jumped in the bushes and i didn't meet him uh my boss at the time thought it was really funny but i just i wasn't ready to meet him yet so but i think i regret meeting him   i understand  what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago  advice i would give myself ten or twenty years ago i would probably say that when my gut told me to do something i should've just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyze it you know days weeks months later if i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more  mhm okay  when was the last time you felt really happy  really happy  hmm really happy i i had a film festival that i was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things were going right but then once the people came and packed the house i was really happy that we had a packed house at this uh film festival so this was about a month ago  nice yeah  cool  what are you most proud of in your life  <sigh> let's see i think right now at this point i'm most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget but it has amazing actors it has a great storyline and i didn't think it could be done but it's done or close to being done and i'm i'm proud of that i was able to get it done i think i could walk away happy knowing that i gave it a really good shot and i think this movie is probably going to take me and the rest of my film crew buddies to higher heights that's great  okay i think i've asked everything i need to oh really  mhm thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  alright well what was your name again  i'm ellie ah ellie  goodbye  goodbye \", 1, 0)\n",
            "(51, \"hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment  i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you okay with this  yes  okay so how are you doing today   okay  that's good  where are you from originally connecticut really why'd you move to l_a um  to be an actor <laughter>  how did you decide to do that  well i moved to san francisco in ninety four and then i moved to atlanta in ninety six and then i moved out here to be an actor and i became a realtor instead  what's your dream job  um to be on a t_v show an actor  how hard is that  it's pretty hard to get discovered and uh  you have to be lucky and you have to know the right people and you have to be talented   yeah  that sucks  <laughter> yeah  do you travel a lot not really no i don't travel that much i used to move um every couple years to a different city and then i've been here for a while so i don't travel much okay  what are some things you really like about l_a the weather um there's always something to do and um that's pretty much it <laughter>  okay  what are some things you don't really like about l_a um the people here tend to be a little more rude and um it's just always a fast pace  yeah i see what you mean  how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a well when i moved here i was twenty five so it was a lot more fun because when you're young in the city you can have a lot of fun    and then i got into the real estate and did really well for a while and then the market crashed and so now i'm old and i'm not making any money so times are tough  aw i'm sorry to hear that  do you consider yourself an introvert no no i'm much <mu> much of more <m> more of an extrovert  okay  what are some things that make you really mad um when i don't get what i want <laughter> and um  rude people  and um  just inconsiderate people  okay  how are you at controlling your temper  i'm pretty good um at controlling my temper when i'm not uh like if i if i drink alcohol it'll make my temper go worse but uh <ss noise> when i don't drink i'm pretty good at controlling my temper   okay  when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about   uh the last time i argued with somebody was  somebody that owed me money  okay  where do you live  uh i live uh in west hollywood  cool  do you have roommates  no no no i live alone i have a dog aw how do you like your living situation  it's good i mean i don't like my neighbors i hate my neighbors but the ones upstairs just moved out so that's good news hopefully the ones that move in are not that noisy and the ones below i just can't stand because they argue with me   why  huh why because they 'cause my hardwood floors they say that eh i've been there for ten years and they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors  oh  that sounds really hard  yeah  who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life  what was the question  who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life  my mother has been a very positive influence she's always kept me on track she lived with me for the last ten years until she recently moved to rhode island to live with my brother wow how close are you to your family  very close to my mother um not so close with my brother mm we're close but we're not like close close uh huh um so i mean we love each other we just don't really understand each other all the time  okay i understand how would your best friend describe you  outgoing um life of the party  ambitious um  and sometimes cut-throat  what are you most proud of in your life  um <psh psh> what am i most proud of  being always able to get through the things i need to get through to get to where i wanna be that's great  what would you say are some of your best qualities  i'm generous i'm loyal uh i'm friendly i'm accommodating and um  that's about it  okay  have you ever served in the military  no have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d yes  how long ago were you diagnosed  uh about four years ago  what got you to seek help  um i well i had <ha> i was beaten up and i had uh identity theft and uh you know i was just afraid to go out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving um and just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did    yeah i'm sorry to hear that  thank you  how have you been feeling lately  um okay i'm panicky about the job situation  um you know 'cause my bills are pretty high and i don't really have a steady income right now  uh huh so uh that's what's worrying me the most is my uh financial situation  that sounds really hard  yeah  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  um  yeah i mean  well basically it's like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing  that's great  yeah i mean it's good 'cause of number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink   mhm um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good 'cause i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving  that's good  have you been diagnosed with depression  uh yeah a long time ago um you know i've taken many medications here and there and um they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would  make me feel hyper so i've recently decided to <t> in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin  just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state   how hard is that yeah did you think you had a problem before you found out  um not really  what were your symptoms  always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i eh eh just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed yeah  do you feel like therapy's useful  i do at some point i've had some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists  um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen   mhm and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist yeah i see what you mean  what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy um well i'm not going to therapy now but  the therapy that i had before um  was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better  mm why did you stop  um i just i wasn't getting the right therapists recently so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so  mhm mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know  yeah  okay  tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed  um  i can't really think of anything right now  okay  when was the last time you felt really happy  um  it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy  i'm sorry to hear that  thank you <sniffle> what's one of your most memorable experiences  um  okay when i was a kid um  i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it  so then a little while later my father  came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them  so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that   <laughter> <laughter>  oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences   wow that's great  yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so  yeah  is there anything you regret  um just the way that i've treated people before when i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so  mhm so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable  that's good yeah  what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago  get in a career that is really stable  like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things  yeah that makes sense  what are some things that usually put you in a good mood  um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work  uh when i'm helping other people  uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood  that's great  okay i think i've asked everything i need to okay thank you  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  you're welcome thank you  goodbye  bye \", 1, 0)\n",

work and a look around the area nice how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a pretty easy actually i do adapt that's good what are some things you really like about l_a the warm weather not having rain nine months of the year um people mainly uh huh what are some things you don't really like about l_a the uh the area how big it is the traffic when i first got here the smog that's better now yeah i see what you mean do you consider yourself an introvert no when i was younger i was but i got outta that with work i did can you tell me about that sure when i became when i my mom died and i needed work i went for a job that was called petitioning and uh you have to go in front of stores and talk to people about signing petitions and you do that after awhile you don't get shy about talking to anybody also when i was in school i took public speaking and i learned that really liked it more than i thought i would that's good so i so i did the census job i actually got up in front of groups of people and talked to them and showed them how to take the test and i enjoyed it okay  what do you do now right now i'm working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance um and i'm gonna start work uh trying to get money from people to uh help kids in the uh in the world that's great how did you decide to do that well the on the uh job helping kids was also a paid job i needed a paid job the uh one for insurance was i was getting older and i needed work that was steady and that's something i can do till i'm eighty five or ninety or whatever  uh huh what's your dream job <laughter> to be an artist really tell me more about that well i've been good with art i like drawing painting et cetera but i didn't know if i could ever make a living in it so i never really got into it and every time i tried it seemed i never got anywhere  so maybe when i get like eighty or ninety maybe i'll go into ceramics or something and do that as a profession yeah do you travel a lot no unfortuantely i don't i'm sorry that's okay how close are you to your family i'm not my mom and dad are die are dead i have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away

sports when they're available uh let's see i used to play golf i may do that again some day but not right now because of the cost and the time okay  what are some things that make you really mad people that are rude uh huh what do you do when you're annoyed well usually i ignore it this morning actually i told a guy to stop what he was doing and we got kind of an argument about it and then the argument was over and it was done   how are you at controlling your temper very good because i had a very bad temper when i was a kid and i told myself i had to control it when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about uh this morning about the guy making lots and lots of noise uh on purpose and uh in a place that was just not the place to do it i mean it was a public place but uh and that was it just a little argument and i'm done with the argument once i say what i say <laughter> has that gotten you in trouble yes can you give me an example of that not right now that i can think of okay  what are some things you like to do for fun uh like read um if i can travel i travel uh i don't travel long distances but even going out to riverside is kind of an adventure for me nice what do you enjoy about traveling seeing things on the way and back talking to people maybe that's great i'd love to hear about one of your trips well a number of years ago i went drove back east to uh massachusetts to do work back there on the way back i took a greyhound bus all the way back from washington d_c all the way back to california   wow uh into washington first and then down from there and uh worked in massachusettes for about oh uh six months to eight months  enjoyed the area quite a bit but didn't want to be there when the snow came and uh enjoyed coming back on the bus had people near next to me almost all the way different people and had a lot of fun that sounds like a great situation have you ever served in the military yeah yeah i was in the airforce and uh when i was eighteen nineteen sixty five during the vietnam war did you ever see combat no i was in great falls montana how did serving in the military change you it it really didn't years later i probably uh learned more from the fact that i got out early and maybe i should have stayed in and stuck with it but i tended to quit things when i was younger and so now that and other things i decided never to quit anything uh huh  what did you do after the military i came down here uh played pool for a number of years uh finally graduated from high school which i had dropped out of when i moved uh went on to college got my bachelor's degree and an a_a degree at pasadena and cal state l_a and started working various jobs and uh that's about it took care of my mom what'd you study at

in your behavior or thoughts lately no do you feel down uh a little bit sometimes about how maybe i should've started doing all this years ago how do you cope with them i just go on i tell myself to basically stop it and to uh go on doing what things to uh improve myself how hard is that not very anymore it took me years to study that to do that i don't know if you call it zen or not but that's great when was the last time you felt really happy uh couple months ago when i passed all my tests and uh medicare <medi> uh medicare advantage and passed everyone of 'em for every company that sent 'em to me that's great what would you say are some of your best qualities i stick to everything i do now i'm persistent  i don't let things get out of hand before i do something about it i used to be uh what's the word i put off things i don't do that anymore uh huh and uh i treat people nicely always until given a reason not to and i don't talk about my bad stuff to anybody usually <laughter> how hard is that not very because the same thing i've trained myself over the years to not talk about myself i talk to other people i talk about them okay  who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life uh let's see my mother gandy um bertrand russell let's see i'm not sure who else other people i've had but i don't remember their names or they were teachers et cetera okay  is there anything you regret earlier in life uh like i said uh stopping everything not completing things i regret very much could you have done anything to avoid it uh yeah i coulda done better what advice

of in your life that i've survived okay  can you tell me about that well i'm sixty five i've been sleeping in my car for a number of years i went from sleeping on pavement to where i got a car  while

behind our house and this wild buck deer was walking in the field and i started motioning to it and it came within about one foot of me and the only reason it left my dad drove down the drive way and it made noise and the deer ran off i was within petting difference distance of him and i wasn't to sure if should've petted him or not but i was about to <laughter> <laughter> aww okay i think i've

move back kind of against my will <laughter> so starting a new career uh starting over in my career it so that's not really something can you tell me about that  uh well i moved back 'cause my dad was sick  so i'm sorry to hear that  thank you  thank you so that's why i'm here but it also means i live with my dad and my brother who are like hoarders and ridiculous so  <laughter>  uh what'd you study at school  acting theater that sounds interesting  it was are you still doing that  mhm yeah  yeah i am   what do you do now  i'm an actor i uh right now i'm doing a a theater show and auditioning and taking some classes and  that sort of thing  how did you decide to do that  um well my parents are both artsy people and i grew up around it and for a long time i was singing and then uh i was went to study musical theater and somewhere along the lines i realized that acting was more my bag than singing i suppose but i still do both  that's great  mhm do you consider yourself an introvert  no i don't  why uh i don't usually have trouble talking to people uh i'm pretty friendly i can get along with most people people usually tell me their secrets within five minutes of meeting me which i feel is a mark of an extrovert <laughter>    <laughter>  yeah what do you do to relax <laughter> um  i take a bath or read a book uh go out with my friends go to the theater uh eh sometimes my work is very relaxing so sometimes just like singing a song or any of that going for a walk  okay  mhm yoga what are some things that make you really mad  things that make me mad um  injustice <laughter> i can be very righteously indignant i suppose um  people who don't see those things and people who've who have a like entitlement i think entitlement and sense of privilege that can make me mad  yeah  yeah  what do you do when you're annoyed  uh  it depends i usually <usual> a lot of times it's i argue my case <laughter> i guess <laughter> um or i i call my best friend usually and complain talk to her about it  okay  how are you at controlling your temper pretty good pretty good i don't have too much of a temper  when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about  um like a real argument or like a debate  uh huh <laughter> um if was a real argument it probably would be my ex-boyfriend and we just argued about why we broke up stupid things like that  that sounds really hard  eh i think i was kind of over it by then but  it was at times  okay <laughter>  when was the last time you felt really happy  um  the last time i felt really happy  was like really happy probably hanging out hanging out with friends the other night i had a good time tell me more about that  uh scrubbed_entry aw that sounds like a great situation  it is it's nice it's nice how would your best friend describe you  my best friend would describe me as an open book she often makes fun of me for like just telling everyone everything um she would describe me as   uh compassionate and uh having a a strong sense of who i am  i think that's good  yeah she also she would describe me as not having like a good sense of social norms sometimes probably that's something that she  why makes fun of me for um because i do just like tell everyone everything and don't realize that i have like holes in my clothes and things like that but nothing nothing bad we have a very good relationship has that gotten you in trouble  hmm has that gotten you in trouble  yeah yeah it has <laughter> not terrible trouble but but yeah it's gotten me in trouble before sure  okay  have you ever served in the military  no i haven't  have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d no but i think i had it  but i never went to a doctor  why um 'cause i had a i had a traumatic situation uh where somebody injured me and i i feel <fe> when i looked up p_t_s_d later i realized <reali> i felt like i had all of the symptoms of like going back into situations like that i would get panicky and um it was very     uh i held on to it for a really really long time uh huh  i think um i think that i did have it but i just i don't know 'cause i never i never saw anyone about it   oh no i'm sorry  are they triggered by something  um  sometimes yeah uh certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger or um it happened in a in an acting class so sometimes certain teachers if they criticize in a certain way i start to i start to panic even if they're totally right and i know they're right and like it's something that someone else could tell me and i'd be fine with it eh sometimes it'll make me a little upset or panicky yeah  i see  have you been diagnosed with depression  no how have you been feeling lately  well i mean my dad is sick so not great  yeah  but um but considering not terrible  that's good have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  um i've been having bad dreams  uh  tell me more about that  uh just like stress dreams i think having to do with my dad   um  uh huh  like getting kidnapped or my teeth falling out things that if you looked them up always say like there's something out of your control which is like exactly what it is so      that sucks  it's not the best but it's just dreams at least so   do you feel that way often  which way  let's come back to that later  okay  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep  easy very easy  what are you like when you don't sleep well  i am tired and maybe somewhat irritable goofy i get really goofy <laughter>  yeah  okay  what would you say are some of your best qualities  um i am fairly non-judgmental  of other people i i i stay open-minded uh i can make most people laugh i'm funny uh creative  um i yeah those are some of the best ones i'd say   okay  do you travel a lot yeah  what do you enjoy about traveling  i love meeting new people and seeing new things and learning uh and just getting out of the routine i like staying in hotels uh i like most things

i don't have any trouble standing up for things that i believe in but sometimes i have trouble standing up for myself i think i i really internalize the idea of like you know women being too needy or uh or um i don't know those kinds of things and then xxx and so as as an adolescent and growing up i felt like well you then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took me a while to be able to like voice what i want what i needed from other people and be okay with that uh huh uh huh  and it's still something i work on  that makes sense that makes sense that makes sense  <laughter> i'm glad you think so  that makes sense what are you that makes sense what are you most proud of in your life  um  <sigh> that's a good question uh  my friends and family  and uh  i my

he's a  he's a very positive human being  um  but um  really i haven't had too many positive influences  how close are you to your family  um  i'm close i mean we <w> we hang out um i i don't tell them everything  um they're kind of judgmental  but um  other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day  that's good  what do you do to relax um  geez um  it's kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch t_v um and i read  a lot um  that's probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping <laughter> i'm a little depressed so um  yeah it's kinda it's xxx like i said it's really hard for me to relax  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep  um  it isn't  um i tend to think a lot  um about the things that stress me out  um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um  yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks  are they triggered by something um  i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh  has affected me throughout the years so um  it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt    um  or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep  but i uh <sigh> i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me  because of stuff that've happened to me  yeah  so um  i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well  okay  what are you like when you don't sleep well  um  tired  i'm uh  i'm moody i'm very sensitive  um  i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person  um which really that's not me um  i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just  i'm just not a not a nice person to be around  how do you cope with them  um  i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um  just to keep myself involved  um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can  um by running around and and and doing things  so  mhm how hard is that  um it's difficult  um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna  i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh  i make appointments to like for auditions or or um  even to do this i um i i tend to uh  just not  like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways   yeah  i see have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d yes  how long ago were you diagnosed  um i've been diagnosed for two instances  um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago  and then i was diagnosed again um in august what got you to seek help  um  the first time it was um  i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um   and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress  uh huh  um  and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um  and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore  so i i figured um  i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um  not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated  yeah  that sounds really hard  yeah  it was  do you still go to therapy now i no <n> do not why did you stop  um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um  get out of my environment  um and uh  and that seemed to help a lot  um  uh huh and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much  um they just  i'm sorry to hear that  they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed  um  yeah  yeah so um  yeah  how have you been feeling lately  <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why   um  but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um   keeping myself busy  that's good  when was the last time you felt really happy  um  actually um  i'm kind of a couple days ago  i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy   um but then i went back to  being you know going back to feeling miserable  so can you tell me about that  um  well i realized  i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep  and um  i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky  um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me  and uh  you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that  and that made me really happy  um  that's so good to hear  yeah  thank you <laughter> what are you most proud of in your life  oh geez um  i've had so many years of just  just bad just a lot of bad  that it there has it's been a long time  since i've been proud of anything  i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through  mhm um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've  gotten rid of themselves a long time ago  but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um  there's gotta be a silver lining  so  yeah  um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh  i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people  and um  and truthful and i still i still have drive in me  that's great yeah  is there anything you regret ugh <sigh> so much um  my last marriage um not getting out when i should have  um  and uh just i regret a lot what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago  <sigh> um the any situation that would've had a red flag um  eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work and um  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um  i i would tell myself um to um  that it's not selfish  to let go of a bad situation  and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself  yeah  so if mhm had i known that then had had i known that then i i i probably would've done better in life so  i see what you mean  yeah  what are some things that make you really mad  <sigh> um people who um  when people are down on me for my faults  um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um  people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy um just anybody who picks on the little guy  um  you know people who don't care about the environment or animals um  mhm i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be  and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do  and uh i that makes me mad  yeah  okay  what do you do when you're annoyed  <laughter> i vent <laughter> um  yeah i tend to vent and then uh  and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore that's good  how are you at controlling your temper mm i try not to get angry um  because i have a really bad temper and it um  and it can get outta hand so um  what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind and come back to it  okay  when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about  um  it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um  it was about um  actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her  and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um  i was i was tired um i was it was late and um  i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um  and you <yo> <sigh> it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person   um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue  mm kinda petty and stupid but  at the time it it seemed  it seemed uh  viable  yeah  what's one of your most memorable experiences  um  hmm one of my most memorable experiences  um  god <go> i've had so many um  maybe it was um  i don't know um  it was  probably um  graduating pharmacy school  that's great  how did you feel in that moment um i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing  uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting <get> ended up getting like ninety eight percent  and um  wow i uh  i actually i didn't <did> i had no confidence <laughter> that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didn't even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um  and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah  awesome yeah  what would you say are some of your best qualities  um  i'm reliable  um  i um  i'm talented  um i i'm a good listener um  i'm always there to help people  um  i tend to always try to do the right thing  um  sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but  um  and just  i uh  all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself um  that's good  yeah  what are some things that usually put you in a good mood um  going to comedy shows  um  just um  having moments where you just laugh with people  um  sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood uh  i don't know probably that's about it  mhm uh huh  okay i think i've asked everything i need to  okay  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  thank you  goodbye bye\", 1, 0)\n",
            "(66, \"hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you okay with this yes okay so how are you doing today <clears throat> okay that's good where are you from originally  um new york really why'd you move to l_a um to pursue um music industry a job in the music industry  cool are you still working in that uh yes what do you do now i'm self-employed what's your dream job um to become a music producer awesome how hard is that um it's pretty hard there's a lot of competition <laughter> aw i see what you mean why'd you move to l_a um to pursue a job when'd you move to l_a uh when um about a year ago last february how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a it was pretty difficult east coast is a lot different than the west coast yeah how often do you go back to your hometown um i think i've been there twice in the past year that's good do you travel a lot no i'm more of a creature of habit okay do you consider yourself an introvert um yes why uh sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd so um it's better just sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of uh you know going in and actively pursue things mhm what do you do to relax um <laughter> probably uh listen to music um and spend time with my dogs cool what are some things that make you really mad um <clears throat> probably um people being insensitive <insen> um not very um very nice to me or um seeing injustices or um i think that's about it <laughter> yeah how are you at controlling your temper um pretty good you know sometimes <so> when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about um probably couple of days ago um one of my friends was saying that um mm uh they were making a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about that that sucks yeah it does <laughter> how close are you to them pretty close how do you know them um my best friend so i um oh just one of my friends okay what do you do when you're annoyed um i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually how hard is that um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion  yeah i understand what's one of your most memorable experiences um um probably spending time with my family in new york how close are you to your family very close that's good who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life  um my sister and my brother tell me more about that um i don't know they're just great people and i love them a lot and they're a lot like me so i feel like i have people that understand me that's good how would your best friend describe you um probably um i guess loyal um sensitive um <laughter>  i don't know it's kind of hard <laughter> it's a hard question <laughter> okay have you ever served in the military no have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d no <clears throat>  have you been diagnosed with depression yes how long ago were you diagnosed gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago what got you to seek help um i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff do you still go to therapy now um not currently i i did about like six months ago why did you stop um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change yeah i'm sorry to hear that it's okay <laughter> do you feel like therapy is useful um yes i do actually um  when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy um i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um    also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat> that's good what were your symptoms um feeling hopeless all the time not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues  um having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life  are they triggered by something um sometimes they are at  like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me  how do you cope with them um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things mhm <clears throat>  how have you been feeling lately um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter>  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately um i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but that's about it okay how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult why um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat> what are you like when you don't sleep well um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter> okay when was the last time you felt really happy um probably christmas time when i was with my family  how did you feel in that moment how did you feel in that moment um just really happy and um feeling like everything was alright in my life  having a good sense of like where i was at that moment being present with myself uh huh that's good what would you say are some of your best qualities um probably you know um let's see that's a hard question i think probably i can tend to read people kinda well sometimes and um  uh i like to say uh i'm good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um i'm a hard worker when i do have a job so <laughter>  mhm um is there anything you regret um sure i mean it's life so of course there's regrets um one that comes to mind is um the wish that i don't eat as much so i can be a lot more healthy <laughter>  what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago um don't take things so seriously <laughter> um enjoy being youthful and um i think that's it <laughter> okay what are you most proud of in your life um i don't know that's a good question probably um my previous job and my employment i worked really well with kids um  so i did a great job at that i was um a researcher um at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out for about six years so seven years  wow that sounds interesting yeah it was awesome how did you decide to do that um i was really kind of like um  reading people and so i decided to major in psychology <clears throat> so uh and then i went a worked in a um mental health facility and did research um with them with um with drugs and depression and things like that so it found like a good niche for me that's great okay i think i've asked everything i need to  <laughter> okay thanks for sharing your thoughts with me no problem <laughter> goodbye goodbye <laughter>\", 1, 0)\n",

learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you okay with this yes  okay so how are you doing today   i'm okay  that's good where are you from originally um pennsylvania  really why'd you move to l_a mhm um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life uh huh  how often do you go back to your hometown  um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once how does it compare to l_a a year um definitely safer and um definitely a more um well i just miss it 'cause i have a lot of family back there but l_a is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here yeah how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a um  not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've been with for three years so that helps he's from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment  okay  do you travel a lot  no what'd you study at school  um advertising communications  that sounds interesting are you still working in that  um no i'm currently working in actually i'm not working right now at the moment what's your dream job um i wanna be an osteopathic physician  tell me more about that  um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to <t> to actually get someone to live  a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine  cool  how did you decide to do that  um well one of the great things was when i came out here to l_a i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast   uh huh  do you consider yourself an introvert   um sometimes  why um well i'm very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and eh i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups okay  what are some things that make you really mad um eh when people don't take into account other people's feelings  what do you do when you're annoyed  um i usually  try to go for a walk if i get <laughter> very irritated  how are you at controlling your temper um i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset   that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about  um <sigh> let's see uh mm i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case  uh oh that sounds really hard  yeah it was he's uh they're i don't know i think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers   okay  how would your best friend describe you  i have no idea <laughter>  what would you say are some of your best qualities  um i'm very trustworthy i'm loyal um i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people um and i always like to try to cheer people up so <laughter> i think that's that would be some of 'em  uh huh have you ever served in the military  no have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d yes  how long ago were you diagnosed  um just a few months ago about in the last six months  what got you to seek help  um i was experiencing  mental issues that i'd never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't  um i knew that i it wasn't that i couldn't overcome it by myself  mhm how have you been feeling lately  um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um  that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working   are they triggered by something  um  i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out i see what you mean  how do you cope with them  um well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um  and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that   i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home    okay  how has seeing a therapist affected you  um  it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling  do you still go to therapy now  i do  okay  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  um <sigh> well i feel like more like myself which is a huge improvement um and i am more cautious and er guarded in some ways about my thoughts um and about my decisions as well i'm not so mhm i'm not so oh you know i'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life   yeah  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep  um it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now um the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours but now i am um sleeping through the night again  that's good  what are you like when you don't sleep well  um i feel <f> groggy <sigh> k i feel foggy and out of it um  and just low kind of depressed  mhm when was the last time you felt really happy mm <sigh> it's um i think it's been awhile  i'm sorry  what are some things that usually put you in a good mood  um working <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic um spending time with my family um yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading mhm how close are you to your family  um very close  that's so good to hear who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life  what is that  who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life  um scrubbed_entry tell me more about that  um well my parents 'cause they've always been very supporting and loving um giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own um decisions my own choices in life and then  my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always um  looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend xxx with this um incident that happened um he's been very uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when i'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and and being aware of that that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or um running errands without having a lot of anxiety  mhm what are you most proud of in your life  um i'm most proud of  the jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped um  is there anything you regret maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at <laughter> that would be it going into retail into unsafe environment not listening to my gut  what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago  um

tell_about_that (can you tell me about that) maybe i shouldn't yeah there was um that was actually one of the times i <laughter> another time i went off usually with him um uh basically i had decided not to go to a private um not to go away for college um so <s> i went <we> i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother and um <sigh> my senior year i was overloading with everything i had maybe like uh four a_p classes i was working at i was working three jobs at the time and i was also in track and field Ellie17Dec2012_06 (wow) so needless to say i was <laughter> i i i i was kinda like burning myself i was kinda like burning myself out and um i wasn't doing well in a_p calculus because i decided to go to a j_c first and transfer also to save money for college too and when i told him you know the teacher called saying i was falling asleep in class um just because mind you after school i'd work an eight hour shift 'cause i was a retail manager at the time so um and i'd come home after that shift to do homework mm calculus let alone um so uh um he would get upset and i told him i spoke with my counselor i already told him that i don't need that class to go to the j_c isn't something that i continue with so i'm just gonna i can't drop out at that point in time so i'm just gonna you know you know just just take the d or fail whatever and he didn't he didn't like that 'cause he is a teacher <laughter> i think maybe that's what maybe where it came from he's a teacher as well um and so he started blaming like my jobs and wanting to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him you know since you're my father you should act like it but i was it was a more aggressive <laughter> way i said it so that was um one thing oh i actually i do i i do remember i do regret one thing um and that is i wish i continued um with college throughout like i i burnt myself out um i was spreading myself too thin there was actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at i wanna say nineteen 'cause i started taking college classes in high school starting sophomore year wow (wow) in high school but i with that that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working i just kinda like stopped going to school for a while and just worked but i went back to finish so but i wish i just would've continued maybe that's one small thing but that's something small though uh_huh (uh huh) yeah Ellie17Dec2012_07 (what would you say are some of your best qualities) hmm i'm very um i'm a very compassionate and understanding person um i like learning

if it's uh be more i won't say be more in touch with my emotions but i think i would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes mhm (mhm) i think that would be one thing because i'm the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me and i'm like okay great thank you i appreciate that but i don't realize how much they do i think that's a realizing how much they care and love me mm (mm) that's one thing i would like to get more of a grasp on yeah3 (yeah) BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you) <laughter> my best friend <deep

ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass operation and it had to Ellie17Dec2012_06 (wow) yeah it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me um if i meet someone new i don't just openly say well you know i've experienced this this and this so i just basically um if it comes up i won't deny it or if it comes up and if it's if it i feel like it's something to talk about i will talk about it okay_confirm (okay) relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax) actually um my relaxation is um i'm currently um living with my mom my mother and uh she's a senior citizen and she's alone um so what i do for uh relaxation or to relieve stress is i actually help <he> help her do yard work take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know aw (aw) control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper) um i'm not um i'm not a short-fused kinda person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as um my temper's concerned there's not there's not much to that last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about) um i'm trying to think here <sigh> i can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i um had a creditor that i was dealing with um being very difficult to work with um and i owed money as far as um some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh i really got a little upset about that because um i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but uh they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that yeah2 (yeah) that_sucks (that sucks) it does <laughter> hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make) probably the hardest xxx decision i ever had to make was um it had to do with a life and death situation with my my stepfather who was battling uh prostate cancer and yeah uh making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was gonna either um help him or there was a slight chance it was gonna help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point or it would it would kill him you know um and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but uh uh you know i i felt like if i didn't try and see if we could save his life <l> help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and and take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run yeah_downer (yeah) been_hard (that sounds really hard) it is it was family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family) um well right now um i'm separated from my wife so uh she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced we're just separated and um we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together and the relationship with my mother's really great you know um she's very understanding i'm an only child so she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late she's in her later stage of her life she's eighty two years old wow (wow) and and so she needs to uh i guess it's good that in in in it's own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels <fe> there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child yeah_downer (yeah) feelguilty (what's something you feel guilty about) probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage um as far as um the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife give_example (can you give me an example of that) uh yeah i um got caught up in a situation where um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship had to do with trust because um it it was devastating to my wife yeah_downer (yeah) describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment) i felt uh when <whe> when it when it came to light um i felt very guilty and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life im_sorry (i'm sorry) ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d) no not at all depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression) no not really no easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep) i don't have problems sleeping that's i i don't ever recall having any problem sleeping so no thats_good (that's good) feel_down (do you feel down) no not at all behavior_changes (have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately) no uh i well i just <deep breath> the only thing i could say is um after i had my heart attack a few years ago um i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that thats_great (that's great) happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy) the last time i felt really happy um probably when i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack and um he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications good_hear (that's so good to hear) self_change (what are some things you wish you could change about yourself) well i guess number one thing is uh my physical being itself i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight um just in general just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally um just not go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them) just one day at a time you know i just uh try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch t_v i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself i do things to help myself mm (mm) regret (is there anything you regret) well there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but um at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done so i don't focus too much on the past i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me eh every day yeah_downer (yeah) advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago) what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed um you know <kno> uh you know i'm not a uh i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and um scrubbed_entry you're what you're doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately uh_huh (uh huh) Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life) probably the proud <pro> what i'm proud about overall is the fact that um i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and uh just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night one day at a time yeah3 (yeah) difficult (how hard is that) it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and um just know that what's not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore mhm (mhm) BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you) um most of my best friends can uh describe me as probably easygoing generous um a nice person to be around and um you know they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues uh related to the gambling and the my and the break-up of break-up of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know uh_huh (uh huh) ideal_weekendC (tell me how you spend your ideal weekend) well my ideal weekend starts off usually um after i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock um i go to a local park and uh it's about this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning um get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that i um you know go home um work in the yard a few hours take a shower and relax and then just uh kinda kick back for the rest of the day and then the the the next day i i do the same thing again in the morning i go for a walk work out in the yard watch t_v whatever just relax that's how a weekend goes for me nice (nice) asked_everything (okay i think i have asked everything i need to)

            "(81, \"<synch> IntroV4Confirmation (hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this) i am okay_confirm (okay) how_doingV (so how are you doing today) i feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had an good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee and uh i have an easy day today so i am just gonna chat with you then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today thats_good (that's good) where_originally (where are you from originally) i was born and raised in los angeles and i'm one of the few locals from around here and uh i went to school away and uh but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles really (really) yes i am like_about_LA (what are some things you really like about l_a) i like the weather having owned a vacation house in another state that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here um i like the culture i like the diversity i like the familiarity i like that beaches uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and uh i think it's a great place to live yeah2 (yeah) see_mean (i see what you mean) thank you dont_like_LA (what are some things you don't really like about l_a) well more of some maybe some of the things i don't like about l_a or say california in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations i'm a small business owner so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated and uh that's a big problem here in uh uh california that_sucks (that sucks) it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh also uh you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't see that but it's a big tax on the social service system and that's what makes our taxes uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of mm (mm) so that's you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state mhm (mhm) travel_shoes (i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot) i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries and uh i don't travel as much as i used to but i've traveled quite a bit and i've learned a couple of languages and uh i served like_what (like what) i'm sorry like_what (like what) uh i didn't really understand uh your question when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and i've been all through europe eastern europe asia south america north africa um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf 'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and uh i try to eat healthy and uh that's a big part of my life travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips) oh sure um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping but really having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger my mother insisted that all of us kids take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school nice (nice) so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french with the french you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me wild_laughter3 ((laughter)) <laughter> so that was a study (what did you study at school) uh i have a few different degrees so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate and uh that was fun and i also have a masters uh degree in economics and i have a degree in crisis management so change_directions (what made you decide to do that) uh i found them um interesting and uh it was something that i wanted to do where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland and i originally wanted to be a doctor but once you start going to school for a little bit you change your mind etcetera so mhm (mhm) still_working_on_X (are you still working in that) um i'm actually in the wholesale business now for wholesale distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business and it's pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past dream_job (what's your dream job) hm actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home and uh uh i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter and uh aw (aw) you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life so yeah3 (yeah) probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing) uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable i think i'm more of an extrovert whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation and be more um introverted i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved okay_confirm (okay) relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax) oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh one of my i have uh several computers at home and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years i had it uh i usually find exercise helps me relax the best or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter> but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but thats_great (that's great) yes that was uh that was it but that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years i think i've gotten better uh at the yeah2 (yeah) i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and be a little more how do you had had the skills earlier control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper) i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged um you know i i am more likely to think before i speak now whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought so i might've said more things that i in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or a work situation um but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties uh_huh (uh huh) so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about) oh wow you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional argument um probably um my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting and uh just uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads so describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment) i felt like i was talking to a wall and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should usually have but you're not really thinking of that because sometimes when we're younger we're looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me but you know i'm pretty easy going and i have different ideas on raising children how she did and that was more not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really discussed those things but it was really just fundamental reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match yeah_downer (yeah) whereas other things looked good you know on paper to both of us mhm (mhm) situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently) hm there's one recently my father passed away uh recently im_sorry (i'm sorry) thank you and really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days and i really only invited very very close friends and family members i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but now as time's passed i wish i'd invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so isee_downer (i see) family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family) um well both my parents are recently uh deceased in the last couple of years and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away in december and we're not super close like i always like i look at other families we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting i guess we're also uh different Ellie17Dec2012_02 (uh huh) and uh i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that we just never did that because we're all all so uh uh different yeah2 (yeah) understand (i understand) yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know but i think every family has their own sort of stuff ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d) um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was but i think i function pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years why_enlist (why'd you decide to enlist in the military) i didn't enlist i was an officer i went to one of the service academies old (how old were you when you joined the military) that um seventeen i started when after high school and i went to a service academy so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into very_young (you were very young weren't you) i was but same age as everybody else that went there combat (did you ever see combat) uh we did nineteen eighty three tell_about_that (can you tell me about that) um just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us so Ellie17Dec2012_06 (wow) that was a it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation why2 (why) that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you you actually play in the game and the same with uh you know if you're in a combat unit mhm (mhm) effectB (how did serving in the military change you) well it made me more patriotic having grown up in california whereas people who are from all over the country and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i ended up becoming uh just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or georgia north dakota south dakota montana right2 (right) grows up with that kind of uh pride so i thought it was good and it unlike so many of my friends that they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan after (what did you do after the military) uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school and i got two graduate degrees and i went to work in private enterprise uh didn't care for it then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic for a number of years and then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell civilian_life (how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life) um at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked and again i was an officer uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile to be able to come back to los angeles uh because it was just so uh so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality so but mm (mm) it was a great experience thats_good (that's good) easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep) um it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um but i generally sleep uh i generally sleep pretty well feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately) i feel pretty good lately you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but boy the last few months i feel great pretty much behavior_changes (have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately) no not really i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately okay_confirm (okay) depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression) um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it and you know it wasn't anything real too debilitating and i wasn't able to really function on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling therapy_useful (do you feel like therapy is useful) i do i was really against it in the past and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it why_seek_help (what got you to seek help) oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it's good talking things out with a a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger understand (i understand) so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that therapy_going (do you still go to therapy now) uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off i do have someone that i go to okay_confirm (okay) yeah therapist_affect (how has seeing a therapist affected you) i think it's nice you know they really if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's always in the past they just help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity yeah2 (yeah) to the situation that's why i like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man uh_huh (uh huh) so but it's um i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good uh_huh (uh huh) happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy) uh this morning i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather and i have a bunch of errands to run and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold where i always i know that term so but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day thats_great (that's great) and i looked forward to feeling the sun so BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you) uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects i'm too smart for my own good and i'm a i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational i'm very resourceful people always call me when they have issues and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or you know i'm great with medical diagnoses uh and uh you know people also say i'm a lot of fun mhm (mhm) i'm fun to be with and um i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white i am what i am i don't b_s you know i'm the opposite of a politician so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them yeah3 (yeah) so that's pretty much landed_trouble (has that gotten you in trouble) no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully okay_confirm (okay) i like to think i do regret (is there anything you regret) uh probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy uh i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger uh but just a lot of it's very typical advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago) really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now i think that's that's it and i would look at things in the long term instead of looking in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life) um i'm proud of my daughter she's a nice young lady i am uh proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service um there are very few people like me who did it who are as had the background in education that i did but i like public service and um so i'm proud of uh that mhm (mhm)  proud of all the certificates i have hanging on my walls at home and degrees sort of like trophies i'm proud that i've been able to stay in good physical shape over the years and knock wood maintain good health asked_everything (okay i think i have asked everything i need to) appreciate_open (thanks for sharing your

from originally) uh i'm from here in l_a i grew up in the san fernando valley really (really) yeah like_about_LA (what are some things you really like about l_a) uh <sigh> well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um camping is pretty close by i've gone snowboarding um i like eh the familiarity i think and you know it's it's a big city and uh you know i'm pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that that i i i would say i like that too cool3 (cool) dont_like_LA (what are some things you don't really like about l_a) <laughter> probably the number one thing that everybody says i don't like traffic i don't like being stuck in traffic i don't like <deep breath> uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know that eh i could stand it being a little <lit> slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but that's fine uh_huh (uh huh) job_virtually (i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job) wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a great question i <laughter> i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun travel_changed (what do you enjoy about traveling) well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um yeah3 (yeah) so i would like to be you know <laughter> if i could make a living doing that that would be great travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips) uh one of my trips okay well let's see the the last trip i i took um lemmi think of one <on> one one more exciting trip um well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles <ca> i'd been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i don't really have too much memory plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age yeah2 (yeah) so i got to see you know my family's old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um like tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it awesome (awesome) relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax) uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax uh_huh (uh huh) control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper) i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about) the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh> i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i don't sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing okay_confirm (okay) feelguilty (what's something you feel guilty about) something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true see_mean (i see what you mean) memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory) um <sigh> hmm um nothing immediately comes to mind i well <sigh> the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadn't have happened not that i wish i i've could erase it from my memory but i eh was um driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know xxx slow rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um <deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened yeah3 (yeah) that_sucks (that sucks) it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck okay_confirm (okay) easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep) well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up 'til one or two every night uh and it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were more um able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven mhm (mhm) and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to going to sleep later and waking up later yeah3 (yeah) feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately) i've been pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health-wise i feel good um you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that behavior_changes (have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately) no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening okay_confirm (okay) ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d) no depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression) no regret (is there anything you regret) well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things um <sigh> in my life uh yeah like i said i i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago) i would say that um <sigh> it's important to to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um that approach it's kinda fatalistic and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place mm (mm) makes_sense (that makes sense) feelbadly (tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself) um <sigh> well i <sigh> i i guess when people i i don't especially um take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should bouts_symptoms (when was the last time that happened) uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody just out of uh college you know um went over what we had done and you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but you know it wasn't our call <sigh> yeah_downer (yeah) memorableB (what's one of your most memorable experiences) mm most memorable experiences um well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun nice (nice) happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy) uh well i've been very happy recently i for the i i'm getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we aw (aw) we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i i've been a pretty happy state the past uh well it's been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i i'm in a happy period of my life right now so yeah good_hear (that's so good to hear)

calm relaxed maybe uh <sigh> intelligent um you know likes to recycle i know that's so something that they would say uh wild_laughter3 ((laughter)) i what else i think that um my best friend might say

education i've gotten i'm also going back eh starting in the fall i'm starting a p_h_d program so i'm happy about that i'm happy about you know breaking some of my bad habits from the past i i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that um you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't know if pride is the right word but um my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh i'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change i'm i'm happy

year usually like for holidays compares_LA (how does it compare to l_a) hmm <sigh> it is <sigh> it's very different um i think it's a lot more mellow um it's way more like suburbia it's nice um it there's something comforting about it but it's always like i get a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle> mhm (mhm) why_LA (why did you move to l_a) i went to um grad school at u_s_c cool3 (cool) adapted_LA (how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a) um it was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in was so intense that like for the first year it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i <laughter> my life was not my own so that made it kind of um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so it wasn't bad uh_huh (uh huh) study (what did you study at school) film hard_decision (how did you decide to do that) hmm <sigh> i uh had an epiphany one day um i was out of undergrad i was kinda floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do and um just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about and um i realized that movies <m> movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school thats_great (that's great) still_doing_X (are you still doing that) um a little bit yes and no it's i don't i'm so <s> i'm like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been uh producing like freelance producer <sniffle> dream_job (what's your dream job) <sigh> that is so the question of the moment <laughter> um i think that uh i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i knowit's sort of what um i want and 'cause basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't wanna do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable um you know full time nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry um and i like you know what i love about producing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and you sort of never know what is gonna get thrown at you that i that's you know it's always interesting and exciting um so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a like room to to grow and advance and all that <sniffle> understand (i understand) good_job (it can be tough to find a good job these days) yeah travel_shoes (i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot) <laughter> i can't see your shoes um i i like to travel um i don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past done a fair amount travel_changed (what do you enjoy about traveling) um i love the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people um i think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know see beautiful remarkable places and just and things and just experience different ways of living and different languages and different cultures <sniffle> travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips) um let's see i went to costa rica a couple years ago um my like best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days  and it was that's probably that might be like my favorite trip of all time <laughter> like it was really awesome but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful um and we just spent like we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of it hit all of the you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything awesome (awesome) <sniffle> relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax) <laughter> what do i do to relax um <sigh> i i mean depending where i am like if it's you know if i'm like at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will you know kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way um if i'm home i might just like you know throw on a movie or like a t_v show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like sort of escape relief <sniffle> okay_confirm (okay) control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper) um pretty good i don't i mean eh it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often <sniffle> last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about) um the last time i argued with someone was <laughter> my mom and it was about money <laughter> <deep breath> describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment) um i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was like judging me unfairly and that was upsetting that_sucks (that sucks) yeah <laughter> family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family) um it's good uh you know they live across the country from me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to my mom on the phone probably like once a week and my parents are really supportive <sigh> um they are you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy <en> i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time um so i'd say we have a pretty pretty good relationship thats_good (that's good) feelguilty (what's something you feel guilty about) <deep breath> something i feel guilty about um <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth> i guess because i'm like in this sort of job hunting phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i should've sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough <sniffle> isee_downer (i see) easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep) <deep breath> um <sigh> usually it's pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good why2 (why) i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out but um i've just had more uh like nights where it either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason um i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking which is weird <laughter> um so yeah it's just i i don't know trigger (are they triggered by something) not that i have been able to identify i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just 'cause like i my job situation is like in flux but i i don't know there was no like event <sniffle> sleep_affects (what are you like when you don't sleep well) cranky <laughter> i value good sleep <laughter> and i'm so i'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good feeling <sniffle> understand (i understand) behavior_changes (have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately) um not really no depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression) yes when_diagnosed (how long ago were you diagnosed) <deep breath> um <sigh> like <sigh> i think in like october or november although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like many many years ago <sniffle> why_seek_help (what got you to seek help) um i felt like i was a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it <sniffle> symptoms_what (what were your symptoms) um <sigh> just having a hard time functioning on the most basic level like just getting up and taking a shower and like going to the grocery store and you know answering emails was just like it took so much energy um so yeah i just i wasn't  really functioning normally been_hard (that sounds really hard)  yeah therapy_going (do you still go to therapy now) yes therapy_useful (do you feel like therapy is useful) yes um <laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so therapy_changes (what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy) <deep breath> i think that therapy is good for me because it helps me focus on my sort of patterns um and also like ah just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like um kind of just reacting to situations i'm like mm just like noticing more what is going on um and it just helps to um i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter> okay_confirm (okay) happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy) <deep breath> <sigh> hmm <sigh> um i don't know um i <laughter> it's <laughter> probably not good that i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale> um eh maybe over uh over christmas being at home with my family tell_about_that (can you tell me about that) yeah um well it just was that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and um like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of feeling not <laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me um so when i was there with them it just um it just felt very like safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know warm familial embrace aw (aw) <laughter> good_hear (that's so good to hear) <laughter> BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you) um <sigh> <laughter> i think she would describe me as funny and smart and um a good listener nonjudgmental um i don't know <laughter> is that enough <laughter> okay_confirm (okay) memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory) <deep breath> hmm <sigh> okay um so this happened the the last like job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like a year and a half close to two years and uh i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat> he sort of out of nowhere uh mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how he i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so oh_no (oh no) yeah so it just like it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way that's like that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter> yeah_downer (yeah) im_sorry (i'm sorry) Ellie17Dec2012_07 (what would you say are some of your best qualities) <deep breath> um <sigh> let's see i um a very loyal person <deep breath> um i am smart i'm organized i <deep breath> um very like caring kind um i'm conscientious and i work hard <sniffle> thats_great (that's great) advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago) <laughter> uh man i think to uh be more confident and less passive um to really like focus on what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves <sniffle> mm (mm) Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life) hmm <sigh> um probably just some of the relationships that i formed with people um just like really you know deep friendships

last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because sort of uh it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing mm (mm) change_directions (what made you decide to do that) well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting um so i wrote some screenplays and uh you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was

of control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't i wasn't mean but i was but i was getting more and more messed up and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so that was pretty that was pretty tough hmm_downer (hmm) avoid (could you have done anything to avoid it) well some of it was was that i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's completely kind of i mean i still get i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not i don't completely lose it for days at a time um so i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then i would've i would i would be i would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different yeah_downer (yeah) things being how they were too_hard (do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself) i mean it's it's possible uh i mean obviously yeah because i mean that's what i do i i take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff um and it's like any little detail that comes up i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still i still get i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there yeah_downer (yeah) been_hard (that sounds really hard) well it's it's not easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better Ellie17Dec2012_03 (that's good) symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them) um well like i said i do a lot of you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just keep my mind occupied during all of that um mhm (mhm) i just need i mean i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet trigger (are they triggered by something) they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that i that i see if i if i if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about just anything you know i can reach back and connect to to this it's really it's really i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break from it that_sucks (that sucks) yeah easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep) um i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally you know don't i don't know i never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly you know i get up i toss and turn all night you know and now it's just it's yeah i don't sleep too great right now mhm (mhm) sleep_affects (what are you like when you don't sleep well) um pretty i mean i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i i usually just kind of power through it and just i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel bad okay_confirm (okay) when_diagnosed (how long ago were you diagnosed) um i think about three three four years ago um it was when i i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for for years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything uh went bad so i don't know describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment) in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm that i had to that i i lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now yeah_downer (yeah) why_seek_help (what got you to seek help) um there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was it was either i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but it was at least that and not firing me but but but yeah but so i got help but it was but it wasn't soon enough downer (okay) therapy_going (do you still go to therapy now) uh not not as much as i should um i go to a couple of meetings i go to i go to a_a so that i can um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that um unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really very i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so it's basically to keep my medication coming okay_confirm (okay) and then there's you <laughter> wild_laughter3 ((laughter)) yeah3 (yeah) right therapy_changes (what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy) well like i said i mean just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now um just saying stuff outloud is just like getting getting this stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing right2 (right) yeah feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately) um you know better than i than i have been um i mean it it sort of it goes <g> it has its ups and downs um you know i'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again um it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is it just has its it's just its own own challenge yeah3 (yeah) good_job (it can be tough to find a good job these days) yeah happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy) um it was probably you know a couple years ago um i i was i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind uh is everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a christmas tree and we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger the bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel you know for that instant i felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person a normal happy person and part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that i don't know if i'll ever feel that again so uh_huh (uh huh) Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life) um probably the probably this educational <educary> educational series i did uh an

okay_confirm (okay) where_originally (where are you from originally) i'm originally from bakersfield california really (really) really when_LA (when did you move to l_a) uh i moved to l_a when i was

l_a um it doesn't really compare to l_a i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i anyways i don't know if i did i forgot anyways um yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small it's the valley um l_a has all the stuff to do it has um oceans and it's by all kinds of um located um by a lot of um cool places like vegas and uh san diego and what have you not so <s> um but yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff but i don't miss like the actual city i just miss uh some of the people that i grew up with yeah3 (yeah) travel_shoes (i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot) oh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot actually i've only been out of california like six times so i would like to travel once i uh have enough money to do so okay_confirm (okay) study (what did you study at school) um well originally i wanted to be a filmmaker and which i still wanna be a filmmaker and i um studying <stu> i was took i took communications and uh did general ed stuff too and um took like video production classes and um <tisk> <lip smacking> did a lot of stuff uh in regards to um filmmaking and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i haven't really used it since i've been back here in l_a i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento but um and then i transferred <trans> um switched over to be uh to business which i took some classes in that but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and become an optician so wow (wow) but i do wanna be uh i actually still wanna be a filmmaker and um that's still one of my plans and i still actually i got into um playing poker a few years ago and i really like the idea of becoming a full time filmmaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of and you have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere change_directions (what made you decide to do that) to be an optician yes (yes) oh um uh i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it's like a trade it's well it's a private college but it just like specifically trains you into um one field and you just learn that you don't do like your g_e and all these other classes like you normally would do for like um like a um a major or whatever you're gonna do so it just trains you specifically to be an optician and jump in the field i um took it just because i actually want <w> want to be a dental assistant and since <si> it sound like something maybe i could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually um got my attention to be an optician so i'm now trying to be an optician makes_sense (that makes sense) and it's interesting so it's fun it's um really hard but it's interesting and it and it um and it's it's fun it has um rewarding um rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel more comfortable with thats_great (that's great) cool shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing) uh i'm definitely outgoing however i can be shy sometimes like i'm kinda shy right now because talking to you and you're uh in a computer and you're a cartoon wild_laughter5 ((laughter)) or uh animated or whatever <laughter> so cool but no usually ninety eight percent relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax) <laughter> um i actually which it is actually kinda funny and i think maybe this might go for some of the poker players too um i don't really i've never really talked to any professional poker player but as far as like um i actually playing poker is um actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like um stuff in the past or present um or future stuff that's coming up uh as far as like i am really relaxed <rela> i really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kinda like a therapy thing for me 'cause i don't like i guess you could say it's a kinda drug because um i don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that's happened in the past i just like focus on poker so it's actually kinda relieving however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like um catch twenty two or whatever but uh hmm1 (hmm) yeah so no poker i play like to play basketball i like to watch movies i like to go to the beach actually one of the things i like to do is go to the beach 'cause it does um it makes me feel good but it i didn't go i usually only go to the beach when it's hot not during the cold season so it's coming up soon so i'm looking forward to that i'm gonna be busy but uh i'll try to go out to the beach as much as i can <laughter> okay_confirm (okay) control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper) um i'm really good at controlling my temper actually i've only been in like i'm thirty years old i've been in like six fights maybe and all six of 'em were started by the other person so i've never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fights when i was a little kid but talking about like real stuff like once you get passed it at like thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no i'm good like every now and then like there's been a couple times maybe in the past where like i wasn't able to control it but um as far as like ever being violent or anything that's never occured and never would but for um majority of the time yeah i don't have like people do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go especially like um on the freeway and stuff but uh last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about) oh well i mean i argued a bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really um petty things i guess that maybe we just i think we were good for each other but uh maybe some other lifetime because uh we just bumped heads too much so obviously she's my ex girlfriend probably for a reason so mm (mm) we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend things situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently) uh um i guess my filmmaking <filmm> um handled differently there's a lot of stuff i could've handled differently but uh uh maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and i was um working for scrubbed_entry production assistant for filmmakers around um where i lived in sacramento so i was doing everything that i wanted to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot all my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment and then i got involved with like uh the wrong group of people i guess and kinda tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything like car job apartment so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with those kind of people that kinda of girl um uh ever uh because <clears throat> i woulda probably it probably my life probably would be a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously i think you should also like if stuff happens good or bad uh <sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again you could um not make that mistake or try not to make it as bad i guess so yeah_downer (yeah) you know hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make) mm hardest decision i guess i guess uh hardest decision the hardest decision i have ever had to make would be um i guess you could say uh i don't really know was gonna say that uh maybe like my ex girlfriend like i could've like stayed with her and i really like still am in love with her and uh would like to be with her and miss her but i guess the biggest mistake <mis> um decision that i had to make was like i know that it wasn't like a healthy relationship and i know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that i don't think it would end up working out anyways so i guess the decision my hardest decision would be to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and uh be uh not with her so i guess that was a hard really hard decision because um i could easily have done it and i guess maybe i would've been happier in that way but stressed out and um irritable or whatever and the other way of having to deal with her i guess deal with each other our our relationship so it was really hard still is so uh i guess that's it not choosing to be with someone that i i loved and loved me or whatever so mm (mm) cool memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory) oh what was that i beg your pardon memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory) nevad i don't understand the first part of that question memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory) oh an event oh an event okay um that i could erase <sigh> uh event that i could from my memory uh my ex girlfriend i wish i'd never met her my first girlfriend and my last girlfriend i wish i never met them 'cause uh we <w> we were together in love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard so i guess both of them easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep) oh it's extremely easy i could fall asleep anywhere i actually the other day i broke a record i almost fell asleep standing up which would've been weird because i guess i would've wow (wow) fallen down or something i don't know i just caught myself wild_laughter5 ((laughter)) i guess i was really <r> i mean i was really tired but i i do a lot of stuff so it's hard for i don't really get that much sleep yeah_downer (yeah) as much as i would like <l> like but i could sleep when i'm dead or whatever so as they say okay_confirm (okay) ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d) <tisk> uh no depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression) no feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately) uh lately i'm just tired but i'm alright i guess i'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month an a week but it's actually it's not i mean i've had worse things happen i mean worse things happen had worse things happen so yeah i guess symptoms_cope (how do you cope with them) <sigh> well i'm a religious person i'm catholic i believe in god i know there's a god so um i obviously even all of it even devoted people to god um regardless of what they are they uh sometimes lose faith so i do lose faith sometimes but it doesn't really last for that long and i know that there is a god i know that i'll be okay and that everything will be okay but you know it's hard um deal with them i i don't really i just keep going you know go to school and work and i just have to keep going i can't give up so i just try to stay busy and staying busy helps kind of and like sleeping a lot helps but i don't get to sleep a lot so um i don't know uh playing poker playing basketball uh_huh (uh huh) deals helps me deal with it and like uh hanging out with my friends helps me sometimes happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy) why uh uh uh i felt really happy on friday because um i went to san diego for the first time and uh i didn't it wasn't as cool as i thought it was gonna be but uh we were like under

give to yourself ten or twenty years ago) oh she's <sigh> um <laughter> a lot of things but i guess i would say like be nicer to like um family members you know a couple family members that i wish i would've been different to um acted different to not that i was like a horrible but i could've been nicer in some instances that if i didn't know the situation at hand uh i would've never like really um went out and partied all the time like i did like high school and different part times of out of high school i would've just really focused on um schooling and stuff and then did the partying later uh wouldn't have gotten relationships that um so i would've just told myself more basically to be more uh have more direction be more focused i guess uh stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people i guess not that i'm the healthiest but <sniffle> um yeah i just would've done a lot of stuff different but i um i don't know if i said this earlier but i believe

know it's kind of it's kind of inquisitive you have to use your mind uh it was like you know brand new something you know very novel back in the in the old days you know back in the seventies now it's everything to computers but back then it was sort of like <sniff> something very unique um you didn't see you know too many computers around back then and um i worked in programming so i was kind of into the logicalness of it you know putting together you know solving a a particular um problem you know come up with step by step solutions on i guess all sort of back then i was kind of more into the the analytic <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical<anal> i can't say that word now <laughter> the analyticalness of the um the problem mhm (mhm) still_working_on_X (are you still working in that) mhm uh no i kinda phased out i still use computers but i haven't gotten i been haven't been in programming for a long time why2 (why) um well i kinda got into a another area kinda diversion <di> uh diversion <divorcion> to diversion to another area in my life uh this is going back to the um the late seventies i kinda took another turn and then by the time i kinda got back into it it was i kinda got into another field so i never really pursued it to the degree that i wanted to dream_job (what's your dream job) wow that's a good question <laughter> i never thought about that uh well actually kinda <ki> ironically <i> ironically actually something was pretty simple at this point in time this is why maybe i'm kinda like made me a little bit depressed and then i um at this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing job but but i do want somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much too much thinking that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the in the old days you know i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job that i i can feel fulfillment on but i don't wanna too tense of a situation i'm kinda at the point in my life where i just want a nice relaxing job yeah3 (yeah) yeah <laughter> see_mean (i see what you mean) yeah shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing) oh i would say well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing um but i generally speaking i'm i'm shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where i'm talking too much like once the funny gates open up they kind of <laughter> open up too much so i have to like back off you know wild_laughter5 ((laughter)) but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as as a general demeanor okay_confirm (okay) relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax) oh really <laughter> <laughter> yeah <laughter> oh um well i listen to music um i'll um well i watch t_v um i'll um just what what do i do to relax well i just try uh avoid stressful situations so like kinda i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends too i'll be around an area around kind of a comfort area where i i feel safe i can just dialogue with people so kinda gets me out of my thinking about my own problems i'm having i kinda just you know focus on being in the moment with my um acquaintances <acqu> friends and acquaintances mm (mm) control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper) um i'm pretty good i don't really have a temper problem it takes a lot to get me to uh to explode i think when i was <w> in my younger days i think i was a little bit more had a little bit slight bit of temper i never had a really bad temper but uh uh temper is not really an issue i have i i tend to be pretty mellow easy going thats_good (that's good) yeah last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about) wow that's a good question um i'm not sure to be honest um i'd have to think about that for a long time <laughter> to be honest i i can't come up with an answer on that it's not really part of my repertoire um nothing comes to mind off top of my head okay_confirm (okay) situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently) well um well the only thing i can think of and kinda going way back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments back about ten years ago i was more um i'm trying to think of what word i'm looking for more trusting of people like uh people and like uh <tisk> who i thought were expert in their field and um i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity <nait> naitivity and um unfortunately i made some bad financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have it's hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up so i would say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions that i really regret isee_downer (i see) hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make) wow hmm that's a tough one i can't think of anything off the top of my head <laughter> okay_confirm (okay) okay family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family) oh well uh don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my um it's just me and my uncle and we communicate <c> we communicate on a regular basis um he lives <li> but he lives in clearwater florida so uh we're we're okay but um uh he's like eight he's he's in his eighties and obviously i'm in my fifties so um we we do we have kinda a small talk he's kinda concerned about my well being but it's kind of on somewhat of a shallow <sh> on a shallow level it's not we don't get really deep and uh he's got his own problems so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in downer (okay) easy_sleep (how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep) um it is challenging uh i don't know why but i do have a medical condition so i think that might be part of the problem and um i have a little bit of b_p_a so ocassionally i'll get up have to go to the restroom and um so to to answer your question <laughter> to make a long story short <laughter> um it is challenging to get a good night's sleep i usually uh wake <w> wake up feeling a little bit tired or achy so it is it is difficult feel_lately (how have you been feeling lately) uh <sigh> well i've been feeling okay i mean um i've been kinda feeling mellow actually um i'm i'm trying to address issues that i haven't taken uh responsibility for but um i feel a bit of calmness as of late thats_good (that's good) ptsd_diagnosed (have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d) no depression_diagnosed (have you been diagnosed with depression) well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think it's called m_m_p_h mhm (mhm) the minnesota multifaceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my my well being psychologically too and i think some of the the answers said that they advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist i didn't follow that up on that because of philosophical differences but uh i think i might have a you know a mild case of depression why2 (why) well you know um like i said i'm just kinda like kinda going along in life i'm uh i'm doing okay but i you know i kinda life's passing me by so i haven't really fulfilled my my goals i you know i'm kinda like alone i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to and i'm not really i'm kinda in a transitional period in my life right now so uh there's a little bit of uncertainty i have some you know kinda financial uncertainties so um you know overall i'm not doing as good as i'd like to okay_confirm (okay) happy_lasttime (tell me about the last time you felt really happy) wow that's a good one <laughter> really happy um let me think about that a minute well actually um it wasn't that long ago actually i went to um <makes sound with mouth> okay i know that one actually i can come up with an answer um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters giving out really nice samples it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from l_a and um you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like have me experience their product or service and um i was around people that i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh about a month ago great_situation (that sounds like a great situation) yeah yeah it was BF_describe (how would your best friend describe you) best friend i don't know if i really have a best friend but uh i would say um hmm i don't know technically i really don't have a best friend so it's really hard for me to answer that so uh i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter> Ellie17Dec2012_07 (what would you say are some of your best qualities) um i i like to be conscientious i you know i do have flaws and every but i think overall i'm conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know say little white lies or you know i'm not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and i'm i'm a hard worker i got <g> got good work ethic um i tend to be pretty calm for the most part mhm (mhm) regret (is there anything you regret) um what do i regret well can you elaborate that <laughter> mind (whatever comes to your mind) uh well um i just well just overall um i regret uh not being a little more assertive in in my earlier uh earlier life um and kinda put myself in this position it's going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of that's sort of like my albatross in my life i made some bad decisions and unfortunately i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like sort of like living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing so i would say that's probably what i regret most of all mm (mm) advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago) well i'd say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um i think i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice i was kinda going away from my basic beingness you know like the way i really felt like for example i'd make i would do aggressive uh investing which if it turned out good it would've been like sort of like winning the lotto i would've been well off for the rest of my life <laughter> yeah2 (yeah) but unfortunately it went the opposite way too too many eggs in that basket so i kinda regretted going with my gut feeling and and let other people influence me and uh 'cause by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some aggressive financial <f> financial decisions so that's pretty much kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret right2 (right) yeah ideal_weekendC (tell me how you spend your ideal weekend) wow that's interesting uh well i've been doing a lot on weekends so <laughter> <laughter> well i do like like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i can actually you know make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time 'cause i do tradeshows but if i'm not doing that then i like to maybe watch some um you know i'd like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game uh go to a movie go out with some friends so i would just or you know just kinda kick back but my main primary <prima> primary focus would be on you know earning earning money on the weekends mhm (mhm) Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life) uh that's interesting most proud of um i would say that i lived by and large i lived a wholesome life i would say i never got myself into any kind of really bad bad uh vice um you know i i lived a pretty wholesome <wholeso> wholesome life i'd say that'd probably i don't know if it's really proud um but as but as far as i stayed the

sitting behind me and he told me that i could not get on that plane because i might have another stroke that was a hard decision 'cause i was in dallas texas all by myself i did not i mean i was in there with an employee but i would be left all by myself 'cause my employees had to go on to montgomery alabama where we were headed and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go but my
